<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Truck Alloy Wheel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Casting</li><li>Forging</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The truck alloy wheel market consists of three primary types: casting, forging, and others. Casting involves pouring molten metal into molds to create wheels, offering complex designs but potentially lower strength. Forging, on the other hand, shapes metal through high pressure, resulting in stronger, more durable wheels suitable for heavy-duty use. Other types may include hybrid processes or specialized materials catering to specific performance requirements. Each type serves distinct applications, balancing factors like weight, strength, and production cost.</p></p>
